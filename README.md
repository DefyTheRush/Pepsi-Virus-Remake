# Pepsi Virus Remake

Re-wrote a friend's Java-based program in C#


Features:
- Lightweight and Portable program
- No window/taskbar icon to make it even harder to get rid of
- Moves your mouse extremely fast to any random point on the screen and clicks in that area

Notes:
- THIS CAN HARM YOUR COMPUTER IF YOU CHOOSE TO RUN IT, RUN IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
- I take 0% responsbility for any damage to ANY person or thing
- By running this program in any way, you take FULL responsbility for what happens

Usage:
- Download the .exe provided at the bottom of this page, load it up and watch the program go

Tips:
- Logging / shutting off the computer can cancel it from being run (It does not save to your startup area)
- Have a program that prevents the computer from shutting down (not saving work as an example) can terminate the program then you can resume worn

You can download the program [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fp6me4gmra9emc/Pepsi.exe?dl=0) (at your OWN risk!)

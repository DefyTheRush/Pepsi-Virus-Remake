# Pepsi-Virus-Remake

Remade a friend's Java-based program (which causes chaos) in C#


Features:
- Lightweight and Portable program
- No window/taskbar icon to make it even harder to get rid of
- Moves your mouse extremely fast to any random point and clicks in that area

Notes:
- THIS CAN HARM YOUR COMPUTER IF YOU CHOOSE TO RUN IT, RUN IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
- I take 0% responsbility for any damage to ANY person or thing
- By running this program in any way, you take FULL responsbility for what happens

Usage:
- Load it up once and see the chaos done

You can download the program [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dt4c9l9756rc4zx/Pepsi.exe?dl=0) (at your OWN risk!)
